/*  Exponential time O(2^n) 
  Algorithms with exponential time complexity (O(2^n))
  have running times that grow rapidly with any increase in input size. For an
  input of size 2, an exponential time algorithm will take 2^2 = 4 time. With an
  input of size 10, the same algorithm will take 2^10 = 1024 time, and with an
  input of size 100, it will take 2^100 = 1.26765060022823 * 1030 time. Yikes!
  The following countTriangle is meant to count the number of points in a
  triangle that looks like this:

function countTriangle(layers) {
  let ticks = 1;
  let count = 0; // the number of dots we've counted so far
  let layer = 0; // the current layer we're on
  let lastLayer = 1; // the number of dots we counted in the previous layer
  while (layer < layers) {
    ticks++;
    let newLayer = 0; // the number of dots we've counted so far in the current layer
    for (let i = 0; i < lastLayer; i++) {
      ticks++;
      newLayer += 2;
    }
    lastLayer = newLayer;
