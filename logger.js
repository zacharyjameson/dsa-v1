/*
  Logarithmic time O(log(n)) 
  <br />
  Logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) is the next
  best thing after constant time. While logarithmic time complexity algorithms
  do take longer with larger inputs, running time increases slowly. For
  instance, if myLogRunTimeAlgo takes 1 second to complete with an input of size
  10, when we increase our input by 10x to 100, the running time only grows to 2
  seconds. When we increase the input size to 1000, the time only grows to 3
  seconds. It is also characteristic of logarithmic algorithms that they cut the
  problem size in half each round through.{" "}
